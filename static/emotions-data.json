Response is too weak, not sufficient to the situation. 2. Response is too strong, more intense than the situation demands. 3. There was no response at all, when the situation demanded some response. 4. The response is at the correct strength, but it is delivered in a hurtful way (if anger) or in an otherwise undesirable fashion. Any of these characteristics may combine. Usually a person is unaware of their intention, unaware of how they are acting, until afterwards. If awareness were to arise during the regrettable episode, the episode would be interrupted. Why do regrettable episodes occur? Because the person is unaware of the emotion that has been triggered and the destructive actions that have been activated. Regrettable episodes are typically manifest with the same characteristic, too strong or too weak etc., again and again. Remedies: To bring awareness to recognize the triggers, and if possible the impulses to actions before the action, or the type of action that is selected. "

      "text": "Often accompanies disgust with one self, and the expectation that if others knew the offensive thoughts or actions, they would be disgusted. The motivation in shame is to never reveal the offensive thought or actions. There is no distinctive brief facial expression for shame. Sadness appears on the face, sometimes with the head turned away or hand covering part of the face. Shame is often confused with guilt, but they differ in that in shame there is self-loathing and motivation to never relevel the misbehavior. It is not just a wrongful act, as it is in guilt, but the self itself which is at fault. Guilt is about a wrongful action, acknowledgment of that wrongful act may elicit forgiveness."
