        "The existence of “compelling evidence for universals in any aspect of emotion” was endorsed by 88% of the respondents. The evidence supporting universal signals (face or voice) was endorsed by 80%. There was less agreement about whether there is compelling evidence for universals in the events that trigger an emotion (66%), physiology (51%), or appraisal mechanisms (44%). Thus, Darwin’s claim in 1872 and the more recent work of Ekman and Friesen (1969) and Izard (1971) regarding the universality of some facial expressions were supported. In response to the question “Which of the following best captures your orientation toward emotion in your research?,” 49% chose “Discrete emotions (anger, fear, etc.) combining both biological and social influences,” 11% chose “Emotions as constructed, either socially or psychologically, to fit current conditions,” and 30% indicated they used both approaches. \n",
        "The respondents were asked whether the evidence for each emotion was compelling. There was high agreement about five emotions (all of which were described by both Darwin and Wundt): anger (91%), fear (90%), disgust (86%), sadness (80%) and happiness (76%). Shame, surprise and embarrassment were listed by 40% to 50%. Other emotions, currently under study by various investigators, drew substantially less support: guilt (37%), contempt (34%), love (32%), awe (31%), pain (28%), envy (28%), compassion (20%), pride (9%) and gratitude (6%)."
