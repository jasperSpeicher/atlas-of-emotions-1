The goal of the Atlas of Emotions is to help people become aware of the impulse to act before acting and then choose whether to engage, and if so how to engage. This means understanding what triggers emotions, which triggers most people share, which triggers we are especially sensitive to and which triggers usually result in a regrettable emotional episode. This isn’t easy to achieve, but exploring the Atlas of Emotions provides the vital, necessary first step. In the Annex of the Atlas, you will find suggestions about other practices you may want to adopt to heighten your awareness of your own emotions."

            "key": "about_body_7",
            "value": "An episode of emotion is a brief, succinct experience, one which does not always fit our expectations. Most emotions arise in under a twenty-fifth of a second and last no longer than a few minutes. We often feel as though our emotions last much longer; however, what we are remembering is likely a series of emotion episodes. The definition of emotion is as follows: \n<br><br>\nEmotion is a process, a particular kind of very fast, automatic appraisal influenced by our evolutionary and personal pasts, in which we sense that something important to our welfare is occurring and a set of physiological changes and behaviors begin to deal with the situation. In particular, emotions efficiently coordinate diverse response systems, thereby helping us respond to important challenges or opportunities.\n<br><br>\nLet’s unpack this definition. Emotion is a process, meaning there are a series of small stages that make up an emotion episode. This begins with our automatic appraisal or perspective of the world as influenced by our personal past (our learned responses arising from life experiences) and our evolutionary past (our hardwired responses that have been passed down genetically). This appraisal helps us filter what is “important to our welfare.” Typically appraisal is so fast that we are totally unaware of it. Because our appraisal is influenced by our personal pasts, we can have quite distinct responses to the world. Consider this example: You are walking down the street with a close friend and an approaching car with its windows down is loudly playing a song. For you this song elicits a feeling of great sadness; it is the favorite song of a friend who died from cancer and was played at her or his eulogy. However, for your friend, who did not know this person and has no association with the song, there is no emotional response, or perhaps there is annoyance about the loud noise. You and your friend are on the same street hearing the same song, but your response is learned and personal. But if that same car had to avoid a cat running across the road and suddenly veered onto the sidewalk, both you and your friend, irrespective of personal pasts, would jump backwards in fear. This is a universal response to an imminent threat. Emotions help us respond before we even have time to think, “What is that car doing?” This is the brilliance and burden of emotions: They can rally our physiological responses to cause immediate behaviors to save our lives, but they arise without our choosing them and can feel quite out of our control. We will begin mapping our own emotion episodes as explorers immersed in this Atlas.\n<br><br>\nThe end of this definition points to the evolutionary perspective of emotions. This means looking at emotions the way we look at our thumbs or eyelashes for their functional properties. While emotions do not serve the critical functions of allowing us to grasp or keeping dust from our eyes, they were just as critical for our survival in the environment in which we evolved. In addition to helping us respond to immediate threats (running from a saber-tooth tiger in fear or standing up to a less-threatening beast with anger), they also helped us form the social cohesion of a tribe through shared enjoyment. Importantly for our early survival, our emotion system includes our rapid internal response as well as nonverbal signaling through our face."
