Rarely felt while those regrettable actions are occurring, but afterwards when consciousness\/awareness comes into play reflecting on what one has done and why. Often it is the response of the target that brings the regrettable behavior into the person\u2019s awareness. Characteristics of a regrettable episode: 1. Response is too weak, not sufficient to the situation. 2. Response is too strong, more intense than the situation demands. 3. There was no response at all, when the situation demanded some response. 4. The response is at the correct strength, but it is delivered in a hurtful way (if anger) or in an otherwise undesirable fashion. Any of these characteristics may combine. Usually a person is unaware of their intention, unaware of how they are acting, until afterwards. If awareness were to arise during the regrettable episode, the episode would be interrupted. Why do regrettable episodes occur? Because the person is unaware of the emotion that has been triggered and the destructive actions that have been activated. Regrettable episodes are typically manifest with the same characteristic, too strong or too weak etc., again and again. Remedies: To bring awareness to recognize the triggers, and if possible the impulses to actions before the action, or the type of action that is selected. "

Shame is often confused with guilt, but they differ in that in shame there is self-loathing and motivation to never relevel the misbehavior. It is not just a wrongful act, as it is in guilt, but the self itself which is at fault. Guilt is about a wrongful action, acknowledgment of that wrongful act may elicit forgiveness."
